                We are often told that ‚Äúeveryone is special‚Äù, which might mean that everyone is unique in some way or another. What if that‚Äôs not true? What if there is nothing that makes you stand out and you are just another sheep in the flock? Well if you don‚Äôt have anything to separate yourself from the flock of sheep you may very well be called mediocre.<br><br>
I‚Äôm pretty mediocre myself, I was never exceptional in sports, academics and extra-curricular activities, I can do more than a decent job in them but nothing extraordinary. Mediocrity is a deceitful trap, because it keeps you believing you are in a good place and never gives you the discomfort to get off your ass to make a change and move forward.<br><br>
When I started writing on Mediocrity I wanted to write about how being mediocre could be the worst thing that could happen to you, but then after a break of 2 days from laptop and getting some thinking space I realised that I was just wallowing in self-pity and misery, nothing else. Now what I am going to write about will revolve around how it‚Äôs alright to be average.<br><br>
The reason why I felt glum and wanted to go on a rant about how mediocrity sucks is because recently for the first time in my life I faced a failure that left me sulking. I‚Äôve had some successes and some failures, but I usually reached the goal I had initially set. Whether I reached the goal or not more often than not depended on ‚ÄúHow bad I really wanted it‚Äù, when I wanted something really bad I typically got it, this was the first time that I didn‚Äôt.<br><br> 
I think that‚Äôs enough to get me some pity, I drifted off the topic for a bit. üòÇ<br><br>

If you ever came across Bell‚Äôs Curve what you would have noticed is that most of the area bounded by the curve is very much near the middle, and as we go to the extremities the area decreases. This area bounded by the curve represents people. Most of us lie in the middle, the comfortable spot if you may call it. Most of us want to be in the right extreme of the curve, well who wouldn‚Äôt want to be? Let‚Äôs make some sense out of this curve by taking an example of football, most of us are average players, some of us above average and some below, let‚Äôs settle it by saying that we‚Äôre somewhere in the middle, now let‚Äôs take Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, they are better than 99.999% of the population playing football and they belong to that right extreme of the curve, a place where some of us can only dream about.<br><br>

<p>
    Being mediocre or being average to me seems like a relative term, it depends on whom we‚Äôre comparing ourselves with, we usually end up comparing ourselves with the people we are surrounded by, sometimes comparing ourselves with others can be a bit problematic however if we compare ourselves with where we could be or should be, it can be a thrust to improve upon our own average. We must amend our thinking. Don‚Äôt compare to others in terms of being ‚Äúaverage‚Äù compared to them. We should compare ourselves with where we need to be and what we‚Äôre capable of becoming. Comparing yourself with others is not a good life metric, comparing yourself with yourself is.<br><br>
I‚Äôm pretty mediocre and I accept it now, some of the most successful people are also mediocre in somethings, no one can be in the right extreme of Bell‚Äôs Curve in every given field, take the example of Steve Jobs he was arguably one of the most successful people in the world, he built Apple from the ground up but he failed miserably in his family relationships.<br><br>
Nowadays, being ‚Äúaverage‚Äù has become the new standard of failure it might be the worst thing that could happen to you. Being the same as everyone else.<br><br>
The problem with this is that more often than not we are in the middle of Bell‚Äôs Curve whether we accept it or not, you might be an excellent programmer but may not be so good in sports. We can't be good at everything, Well-roundedness is a myth! <br><br>
People might say that if you accept that you‚Äôre mediocre you lose the scope to grow in life, never improve and won‚Äôt achieve your dreams and aspirations, I would have said it myself a week ago however that is a very dark place to put yourself in, what you‚Äôre effectively saying is that people who are ‚Äúaverage‚Äù are pretty much worthless.<br><br>
Everyone is average at some point of time in whatever they do, those people on the extreme right of the Bell‚Äôs Curve don‚Äôt just prop out of no-where, people have this misguided belief that successful people were made overnight, what they often miss out is the years of hard work and perseverance that help those successful people to excel in their fields, the mistakes they made the failures they endured the lessons they learnt, all this is buried under the hood and we often forget about it.<br><br>
Now I won‚Äôt write those feel good clich√©d lines that people throw at you whenever you‚Äôre feeling down to drag you out of despair like ‚ÄúEveryone can achieve greatness‚Äù, the harsh truth is everyone cannot be great at whatever they do, the sooner we realize it the happier we will be. Maybe for once we should stop thinking of ourselves as the next big thing and focus on more achievable goals growing each passing day. I‚Äôm not asking you to stop dreaming or believing I‚Äôm just asking you to lower your expectations a bit.<br><br>
What I mean by embracing mediocrity is to let go of the dogma that mediocrity means failure. Try improving everyday in whatever you do, choose a few areas where you want to be in that top 10% work hard to achieve it, you can‚Äôt be extraordinary at everything nor you should settle for average everywhere. In the end life is a game with a levelled playing field staring at birth and ending at death how we play this game, what we learn, whom we love, how much we enjoy, how we live is completely our choice.<br><br>
